     <h2>Directions</h2>
     
     <h3>Step 1</h3>
     <ul>
        <ol>
     Line the bottom of a 7- to 7 1/2-inch springform pan or cake pan with parchment paper. 
     Stir together graham crackers and 1 tablespoon sugar in a bowl. Stir in melted butter. 
     Press crumb mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan.
    </ol>
   </ul>
     
   <h3>Step 2</h3>
   <ul>
    <ol>
        For the filling, combine cream cheese, sour cream, 1/3 cup sugar, lemon juice, 
        vanilla, and salt in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at medium-high speed 
        until smooth. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating at low speed just until combined. 
        Pour filling over the crust. Arrange pan in the air fryer basket..
    </ol>
</ul>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
    <ol>
        Set air fryer to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
    </ol>
   </ul>

   <h3>Step 4</h3>
   <ul>
    <ol>
        Cook for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C) and 
        cook 20 minutes more. The center of the cheesecake will appear wet and may 
        jiggle slightly. Transfer cheesecake to a wire rack. Let stand about 15 minutes. 
        Using a small sharp knife or thin spatula, loosen cheesecake from sides of pan; 
        let stand until completely cooled, about 30 minutes more. Remove cheesecake 
        from pan. Chill, covered, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.
    </ol>
</ul>

   <h3>Step 5</h3>
   <ul>
    <ol>
        To serve, drizzle with chocolate and caramel ice cream toppings 
        and sprinkle with pecans.
