    <h2>Crock-Pot Hot Chocolate Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      Here's what you'll need to make the best slow cooker hot chocolate of your
      life:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Milk:</strong> This easy slow cooker hot chocolate starts with
        regular milk (whole or reduced-fat will work best). If you use an
        alternative milk, opt for something creamy like oat milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> Semisweet chocolate chips create a
        perfectly balanced flavor. You could also use milk or dark chocolate
        chips.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heavy whipping cream:</strong> Heavy whipping cream is the key
        to a creamy, decadent, rich slow cooker hot chocolate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sweetened condensed milk:</strong> Like so many decadent
        recipes, this hot chocolate calls for a can of sweetened condensed milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vanilla:</strong> A teaspoon of vanilla extract lends complexity
        and takes the overall flavor up a notch.
      </li>
